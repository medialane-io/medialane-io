/**
 * Wallet-unlock orchestration shared by every write flow.
 *
 * An io wallet is unlocked by EITHER a PIN or a passkey — chosen once at
 * signup, never both. A passkey user has no PIN, so any PIN-only flow locks
 * them out: `decryptPrivateKey` runs with the wrong secret and fails as
 * "Malformed UTF-8 data" / "Decryption resulted in empty string".
 *
 * Authoritative vs device-local signal: ChipiPay's `hasWalletPasskey()` reads
 * `localStorage` only — it's device-local, so a passkey user on a fresh
 * browser reads `false`. We therefore prefer the cross-device record we keep
 * in Clerk `publicMetadata.walletAuthMethod` (see `recordWalletAuthMethod`),
 * and use the device-local flag only as a fallback / to backfill the record.
 *
 * This hook centralises the decision so flows never hard-code a PIN prompt:
 *  - passkey users unlock silently with Face ID / Touch ID (no PIN dialog);
 *  - PIN users get the PIN dialog;
 *  - a passkey failure falls through to the PIN dialog so no one is hard-stuck.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { unlock, pinDialogProps } = useWalletUnlock();
 *   await unlock((secret) => executeTransaction({ pin: secret, calls }));
 *   <PinDialog {...pinDialogProps} title="…" description="…" />
